<p>This is a very subjective piece as it is about my own personal experience between the two cities.</p>

<p>My character is a female Miqo’te that was created on the Zalera server of the Crystal datacenter.
She was primarily designed by my wife who spent about 30 minutes looking at all the hair styles to pick out the one that she really liked. I ended up changing her hair-style afterwards when I unlocked the hairstylist in-game.</p>

                <p><p>This post is actually quite late considering that I arrived in the pacific north west in January.
Life has been quite busy before and since then and I’ve just finally found time to sit down and actually let out my thoughts.
I think the feeling is similar to arriving at your destination so I named this post accordingly.</p>
