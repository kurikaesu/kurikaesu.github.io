<p>This post is actually quite late considering that I arrived in the pacific north west in January.
Life has been quite busy before and since then and I’ve just finally found time to sit down and actually let out my thoughts.
I think the feeling is similar to arriving at your destination so I named this post accordingly.</p>

<h2 id="what-is-this-blog-going-to-be-about">What is this blog going to be about?</h2>
<p>I’ve read a lot of advice from other software developers that they really recommend practicing writing.
As a software developer, we do spend a lot of time typing at our keyboards; code, documentation and communication with others.
The content of this blog however is not going to primarily be related to software development or engineering.
I spend a lot of my time playing video games, hiking, exploring and studying finance so these will be prominently written about.</p>
