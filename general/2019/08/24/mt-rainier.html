<p>I went to Mt Rainier on the 10th of August to hike a few of its trails. We had hoped that the weather would have been clear enough for us to see the mountain in all of its glory but it was unfortunately raining the whole time we were there.</p>

<h3 id="packwood">Packwood</h3>

<p>We started our journey from our accomodation in Packwood, WA. The place we stayed at was a house or cabin in a small corner of the small town.</p>

<p>It was a cosy place that had a pretty nice feel to it</p>

<p>The town of Packwood is really quite small. The main town strip has only a handful of stores and a local library that acts as the town center.</p>

<p>The last photo above was an elk that was wandering around town with its pack of females.</p>

<p>From this town we headed up north towards Mt Rainier and were greeted to more trees and unfortunately rain and fog.</p>

<p>We met a lot of Marmots and Chipmunks while hiking around the place.</p>

<p>Overall it was a pleasant experience and I do believe that had there been no rain, it would have been a very colorful and beautiful view.</p>

<p>We are definitely going to go back when we get the chance to!
In the future, weâ€™ll be planning on visiting Mt Baker and getting some nice hikes and photography happening over there too so keep an eye on my blog and hopefully it will pop up!</p>
